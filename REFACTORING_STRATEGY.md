# MKN MS v2 - Professional Refactoring Strategy

## CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
- ✅ Working member management feature
- ✅ Clean project structure after cleanup
- ❌ Large monolithic files
- ❌ No testing infrastructure
- ❌ Not API-ready patterns
- ❌ Basic TypeScript usage

## PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE & STRUCTURE
1. Split large component files into focused modules
2. Setup professional testing (Vitest + Testing Library + JSON Server)
3. Create API service layer with proper error handling
4. Implement strict TypeScript patterns

## PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE
5. Implement barrel exports and clean import paths
6. Enhance state management with React Query patterns
7. Add comprehensive error boundaries and logging

## PHASE 3: PRODUCTION READINESS
8. Code splitting and performance optimization
9. Component documentation with Storybook
10. CI/CD pipeline foundation

## SUCCESS METRICS
- All files under 200 lines
- 80%+ test coverage
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- API integration ready
- Professional import patterns
